The assignment was to create two models to predict whether a loan was in default based on the borrower's loan size, interest rate, income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt. The two models were then anlyzed to see which model did a better job of making the prediction. A confusion matrix, precision, sensitivity, and F1 scores were used to compare the accuracy.
